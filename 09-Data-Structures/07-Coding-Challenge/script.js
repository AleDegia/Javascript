  //1)create one player array for each team (players1 and players2)
  const players1 = game.players[0];
  const players2 = game.players[1];
  //2) the first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field players. for team 1 create one variaable with the goalkeeper's name, and one array (fieldPlayers) with all remaining 10 fields players
  
  const [neuer, ...otherPlayers]= [...players1]; //destrutturo l'array players1
  console.log(neuer, otherPlayers); //'Neuer' e array
  const gkTeam1 = neuer;

  //3) crea un array 'allPlayers' contenete tutti i giocatori di entrambi i team
  const allPlayers = [...game.players[0], ...game.players[1]];
  console.log(allPlayers);


//4) During the game team 1 used 3 substite players, so create a new array ('Players1Final) containing all the original team1 players
//plus 'Thiago', 'Pippo' e 'Persic'
const players1Final = [...game.players[0], 'Thiago', 'Pippo', 'Persic'];

//in maniera piu veloce potevo fare cosi:
const {odds: {team1, x: draww, team2}} = game;


//6) Write a function printGoals that receives an arbitrary number of player names and
//prints each of them on the console, along with the number of goals that were scored in total

};
printGoals(game.scored); //1 goals were scored (perch√® non stiamo passando gli argomenti uno per uno)
printGoals(...game.scored); //4 goals were scored



//7) print witch team is more likely to win based on the odds variables
team1 < team2 && console.log('Team 1 is more likely to win');
